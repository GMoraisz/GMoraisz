# Hi! I am Gabriel Morais, and here are my Projects  üëã

Actually I'm Studying Systems Analysis at FEMA, I am currently focused on developing programming skills, with an emphasis on web technologies. I have solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript, as well as notable knowledge of MySQL Database.
I demonstrate remarkable ease of learning, which allows me to quickly assimilate new information and technologies. I am dedicated to improving my skills in the Front-End area, consolidating my knowledge in the basics and then embarking on more advanced learning with React.
Furthermore, I have intermediate knowledge of English, which allows me to communicate effectively and read technical documentation. I'm looking for a challenging opportunity in the Front-End area, where I can apply and expand my technical skills, contributing to innovative projects. I am confident that my passion for programming, my determination to constantly learn, and my English skills make me an enthusiastic candidate committed to success.
